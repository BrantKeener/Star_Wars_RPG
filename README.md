# Star_Wars_RPG
A simple action/RPG based in the Star Wars universe

The Star Wars RPG allows players to choose a character from the Star Wars universe. The character will then battle the AI players. Player characters will continue to gain attack power so that they can take on stronger and stronger characters. Players must choose carefully in what order they will fight the enemy characters so that they can defeat all of the opponents.

This project should be used to destress after a long day of work.

Project contributed to, and maintained by Brant Keener.
